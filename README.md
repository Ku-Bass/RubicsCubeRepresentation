## Rubics Cube Representation (from scratch in C#)
By Ku-Bass
## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a simple 3x3 Rubics cube class, that has some basic functionalities which make it a great starting point for more complex programs 
involving Rubics cubes.

## Functionality 

Each instance of the Cube class represents a separate cube which can:


>Print cube sides to console

>Scramble itself

>Make a specific move  (classical R L U D F B and their prime(opposite) versions)

>Move randomly

>Make a clone of itself (to be saved in another instance)

>Can determine if it's solved

>Can tell you how many squares are of the correct color (48 means cube is solved => middle pieces don't count)

## Instructions 

>Feel free to use this code in your projects however you want (Maybe you can build a solver AI around it or just use it as a fun sidequest in a game. It's totally up to you)
